=============================================================

A simple, but robust, jQuery slider plug-in. Very basic, simple to use and modify.

TODO:

- Bug with horizontal slider - goes a bit apeshit when left running in the background
- Code for horizontal sliding could be refactored and optimised
- Markers should update on click, not after slide animation is complete
- Keyboard navigation
- Look at adding captions
