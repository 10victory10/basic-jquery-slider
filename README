A simple jQuery slider plug-in. Very basic, simple to use and modify.

TODO:

- Bug with horizontal slider setting - goes a bit apeshit when left running in the background
- Code for horizontal sliding could be refactored and optimised
- Markers should update on click, not after slide animation is complete (should be able fix when refactoring)
- Keyboard navigation (left + right arrow controls)
- Look at adding/displaying captions using img alt tags
